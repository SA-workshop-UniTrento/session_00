# **Sequence Analysis in the Social Sciences**

This repository contains the material for the Sequence Analysis Workshop at UniTrento by Emanuela Struffolino 

## **Course description**

This workshop introduces sequence analysis for social science research. Sequence analysis, originally developed in biology to analyze strings of DNA, has attracted increasing attention in the social sciences for the analysis of longitudinal data. Most applications study life course processes, including labor market careers, transitions to adulthood, or family formation. This workshop covers longitudinal data management (only briefly; with Stata), basic techniques of sequence analysis (with Stata, but mainly with R), as well as recent methodological developments tailored at social science research questions. Topics include different ways of calculating distances between sequences, cluster analysis after sequence analysis, sequences visualization, techniques for analyzing sequences' multidimensionality and the association between sequences' unfolding over time and independent variables. All methods are demonstrated with hands-on examples using Stata (SQ package, for data preparation and basic sequence analysis) and R (TraMineR package).

The detailed program for this course can be found in the file "Agenda.pdf".

## **Learning Objectives**

The participants will learn:

- How to prepare longitudinal data in Stata to use them for sequence analysis in R.
- How to describe and visualize sequences with the powerful and flexible TraMineR package in R
- How to use the outcomes from sequence analysis (distance matrices, measures of turbulence and complexity) in further analysis (cluster analysis; regression analysis; discrepancy analysis; implicative statistic for sequences of typical states; sequence analysis multistate model procedure; multichannel sequence analysis).

In short, the participants will learn all the tools required to conduct and publish their own research applying sequence analysis.

## **Credits and Acknowledgements**

In creating this course I was drawing on the excellent material from previous workshops taught by myself, friends and colleagues. 
Credits go to Marcel Raab, Anette Fasang, Silke Aisenbrey, Christian Brzinsky-Fay, Matthias Studer, and Zachary van Winkle.

I also want to take the opportunity to thank the entire team behind the TraMineR-package (Alexis Gabadinho, Nicolas S. Müller, Gilbert Ritschard, Matthias Studer, Reto Bürgin, and Pierre-Alexandre Fonta) for their tremendous work on this amazing toolbox for exploring sequence data.

Finally, I also want to thank the German Family Panel (pairfam) for the permission to share a teaching version of their great data without any further paperwork.
